# Tory Snopl's Prework Study Guide

## Description

I built this website to help bootcamp students prepare for the course ahead of them. A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is invaluable prior to the start of class. Being able to see all three elements come together in real time helps solidify the principles being practiced and applied. These skills will be extremely helpful in future projects. 

## Usage

The website is a good simple learning enviroment where a basic, one page site is using the three 'languages' together. It also serves as a good playground to change code and see the effects without having too much code to sort through. 

## Credits

I'd like to thank the University of Oregon coding bootcamp for the tutorials and guides that led to the creation of this website. 

## License

This site is an MIT license meaning you are free to use however you like. 

## Features

One feature that I am proud of above and beyond the tutorial is using the <abbr> tag in the HTML and CSS notes.

## Tests

Feel free to test the JavaScript in the Console tab of the devtools.
